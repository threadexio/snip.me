# :scissors: snip.me

This is a stupidly simple single page webapp that allows you to create somewhat good-looking code snippets. That's it.

This abomination was made by someone, me, with near 0 experience in this sort of thing. It uses no fancy framework like Vue or React or whatever else, just pure handwritten html, javascript and css. Please do not hate on it too much, know that this whole project took ~4-5 hours from my life. I hope you find it at least a bit useful!
